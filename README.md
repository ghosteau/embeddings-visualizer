# **Embeddings Visualizer for Language Models**
A (hopefully soon-to-be) website, API, and project for visualizing embeddings for transformer language models such as GPT, RoBERTa, BERT, BART, and more!
___________________________
### What is this project?
This project provides an interactive platform for exploring and understanding token embeddings from transformer-based language models. It loads models like GPT-2, RoBERTa, BERT, and others, extracts their embedding spaces, and visualizes relationships between tokens using dimensionality-reduction techniques. The goal is to make it easy for researchers, students, and developers to inspect how language models represent meaning, similarity, and structure in high-dimensional vector spaces.
